Features:
- Load an image and present it (hardcoded image address is ok)
- Ask the user to trace a shape ("Please draw a path to create a puzzle piece") 
- Trace a path freely by pressing the mouse and moving it. once mouse is up, close the shape 
- The new cut shape should be draggable paint the hole (where shape was cut from) in gray shape will have an x icon attached on it's border tapping on the x button will delete the shape and fill the hole back.
